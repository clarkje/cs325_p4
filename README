run the following on the commandline:

   python tsp_tour.py [nameofinputfile.txt]

Where [nameofinputfile.txt] is replaced by the name of an input (txt) file.
For example:

   python tsp_tour.py test-input-1.txt

Each time you run this command, the algorithm will run for exactly 179 seconds
in an attempt to reach the best solution possible.

After the 179 seconds are up, the program will write to an outputfile in the form of
    [nameofinputfile.txt].tour

The above example would return:
    test-input-1.txt.tour


NOTE: Please do not run 'watch.py'. Our tour will not complete. For this reason,
we've included our own timing method that kills the algorithm when time is up.
